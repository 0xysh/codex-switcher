# Documentation Index

This index is the authoritative entry point for project documentation.

## Core Docs

1. `docs/engineering-standards.md` - architecture, scalability, testing, and documentation governance rules.
2. `docs/ui-ux-architecture.md` - UI boundaries, accessibility contract, and UI quality checklist.
3. `AGENTS.md` - repository-wide operational guide for coding agents.

## Planning Docs

- `docs/plans/` - dated implementation plans and review appendices.

## Update Policy

- If architecture or workflow changes, update `docs/engineering-standards.md` and `AGENTS.md` in the same PR.
- If UI behavior or boundaries change, update `docs/ui-ux-architecture.md` in the same PR.
- If a new persistent workflow is added, include it in this index.
